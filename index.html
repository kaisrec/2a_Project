This month's challenge invites you to select the olive oil flavor of the month out of the three flavors indicated. If you select the correct flavor in one try, you'll receive a 24-ounce bottle of that flavor in the mail. Good luck playing the &quot;Flavor of the Month&quot; game! </p>

    <p>&quot;We serve only <span class="twoTreesName"><em>Two Trees Extra Virgin Olive Oil</em> </span>at Iodice's Trattoria. There simply is no other olive oil that meets our standards.&quot; - <span class="testimonialName">Samantha Iodice, restaurant owner</span></p>
    <p><em>&quot;<span class="twoTreesName">Two Trees Olive Oil</span></em> is the only olive oil I would even consider cooking with or serving. It's the most authentic oil I've tasted since living in Italy.&quot; -<span class="testimonialName"> Giselle Varialle, Master Chef</span></p>
    <p>&quot;The flavored oils have a remarkably authentic, smooth, and mild flavor - nothing like the other flavored oils you'll see in your local market. They are superb on pasta, bread, and vegetables.&quot; - <span class="testimonialName">Thomas Garner, Hobby Chef</span></p>
    <p>&quot;I give two thumbs up to <em class="twoTreesName">Two Trees Olive Oil</em>! It's the best.&quot; - <span class="testimonialName">Laura Taylor, <em>Good Eats, Good Drinks Magazine</em>.</span></p>
